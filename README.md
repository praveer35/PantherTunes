Our WEBSITE/APP provides a place where people can come together and create music. 

As music becomes more accessible, the number of people interested in making it is growing. 
Creating music is something so many people would love to do, yet it is quite difficult to turn an idea into a professional recording for an audience. Traditionally, to refine musical ideas lots of money is often needed for producers, studio time, and input on songs. Our service lets people come together and share musical ideas and inputs. 

User posts a clip with a song idea (whether instrumental, lyrics, or both), may be only a snippet of a musical idea
Uploader will post video or audio recording or lyrics and ask for input  (General or specific ie I wrote this melody and need words, I need help wording the second verse of this song, I have a beautiful poem and need a great chord progression to set it to)
People can comment opinions, or ask to join the collaboration with the user
This would create a new tab of people in the collaboration 

Encourages people to come together and work on a project to feel their musical voice is being projected somewhere.
